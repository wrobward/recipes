Ingredients
4 blocks Philadelphia Cream Cheese
4 eggs
1 1/3 cup sugar
1 tbsp vanilla extract
1/2 lemon

2 cups graham crack crumbs
1 bar unsalted sugar
2 tsps of sugar

1 lb sour cream
1/4 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 lemon

Remember to leave the eggs and cream cheese out overnight to get to room temperature.

Mix the graham cracker crumbs and sugar together. After melting the butter, add and mix throughouly to the graham cracker crumbs and sugar. Before you add these to your springform pan, make sure you have buttered it well.
Push the mixture evenly around the base of the pan. 

Preheat the oven to 450 degress Farenheit. Cook for 5 minutes.

Now, mix the cream cheese and sugar. I usually add 1/3 cup of sugar and 1 block at a time and mix until smooth until I have repeated with the other blocks. Now, add teh vanilla extract and juice of half of a lemon. Mix and add the eggs one by one. Make sure you do not mix it too much or you will add too much air to the mixture.

Add to the springform pan on top of the bread crumbs. 
Reduce the oven temperature to 275 degrees Farenheit.
Add in the cheesecake and a pan on the bottom with ice to the oven. This pan I just keep on the rack below, I do not create a water bath.

Do not check the oven for at least an hour. Check and jiggle the pan. The outside rim should stay firm while the middle should move a little. Your cheesecake is done cooking.

Now mix the sour cream, sugar, juice of 1/2 lemon, and vanilla extract together and whip until smooth. Pull out the cheese cake and add on top.

Heat oven to 450 degrees and cook for 10 minutes. 

Pull out and chill at room temperature for at least 3 hours. Chill over night.
